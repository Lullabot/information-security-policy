# Lullabot VPN

### Policy
The use of the virtual private network (VPN) is required when accessing Lullabot servers and strongly recommended when accessing any accounts and servers from unknown or untrusted locations.

### Scope
This policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.

### Compliance
Critical assets are only available via the VPN, like the Daily Report and edit.lullabot.com. Since employees and contractors must use the VPN to access some assets, they should already have their devices configured to use the VPN, and will be more likely to use it.

### Explanation and Implementation

Lullabot provides a VPN that provides a secure internet connection from your computer directly to one of our servers, which then forwards your traffic out to the internet. Instructions on how to connect can be found at https://www.dropbox.com/work/Lullabot/VPN. The VPN protects your traffic from being intercepted and viewed by any local network device, or even by your ISP, which means that you are protected from the creepy guy in the corner of Starbucks that looks like he is up to no good. (Yes, Dave Anjerad, we see you.)

It is important to understand that this only protects your traffic as it moves from your computer to our server. This means that once your traffic leaves our server, it is not any more secure than it would have been anyway. The protection is from other users or devices on your local network.

Using the VPN connection also makes all of your internet traffic appear to be coming from a Lullabot server, which means that you can connect from anywhere in the world, and as far as the greater internet is concerned, you look like you are sitting in Newark, NJ. This means that when there are access restrictions on a project, our VPN address can be whitelisted, and you can connect from anywhere.

Finally, your VPN connection bypasses any local network restrictions. For example, it is not uncommon for public wifi hotspots to block services like IRC. If you don't know what IRC is, don't worry about it. By connecting to the VPN, you will automatically bypass any of these network-level restrictions.

In general, the VPN is only for work-related use, because Lullabot is billed for the bandwidth used. That said, you should not stress out over whether something is using VPN bandwidth or not. For example, if you are connected for client work, it is fine if you visit reddit while you are taking a quick break, or if you listen to Pandora while you work, or if you want to participate in Dance Music Friday with your coworkers. It is also highly encouraged to use the VPN any time you are using public wifi at a coffee shop, airport, hotel, etc. This is especially true if you are using the same computer or other
device that you use for work.

If in doubt, err on the side of caution and use the VPN. Your protection is worth the price of the bandwidth.
