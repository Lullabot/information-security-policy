A VPN should be always be used when working from unknown or untrustworthy locations, like public networks.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.\nCompliance\n\nCritical assets will be available only to employees via the Lullabot VPN, like the Daily Report and edit.lullabot.com.\nSince employees must use the VPN to access some internal assets, their devices will  be VPN-enabled. This will make it easy to use the VPN when they are working from any untrustworthy location.\nSome Lullabot clients provide a VPN that is the only way that client assets can be accessed. Employees and contractors working with those clients will not be able to do their work without using the VPN.\n\nExplanation and Implementation\nLullabot and some of its clients provide VPNs that create secure internet connections from your computer directly to internal servers, which then forwards your traffic out to the internet. A VPN protects your traffic from being intercepted and viewed by any local network device, or even by your ISP.\nIt is important to understand that this only protects your traffic as it moves from your computer to an internal server. This means that once your traffic leaves the internal server, it is not any more secure than it would have been anyway. The protection is from other users or devices on your local network.\nUsing the VPN connection also makes all of your internet traffic appear to be coming from a Lullabot server, which means that you can connect from anywhere in the world, and as far as the greater internet is concerned, you look like you are sitting in Newark, NJ. This means that when there are access restrictions on a project, our VPN address can be added to an access control list, and you can connect from anywhere.\nFinally, your VPN connection bypasses any local network restrictions. For example, it is not uncommon for public wifi hotspots to block services like IRC. By connecting to the VPN, you will automatically bypass any of these network-level restrictions. It is highly encouraged to use the VPN any time you are using public wifi at a coffee shop, airport, hotel, etc. This is especially true if you are using the same computer or other device that you use for work. If in doubt, err on the side of caution and use the VPN.\nInstructions on how to connect to Lullabot's VPN can be found at https://www.dropbox.com/work/Lullabot/VPN. \n"},"access/passwords.html":{"url":"access/passwords.html","title":"Passwords, PINs, and Passcodes","keywords":"","body":"PINs, Passcodes and Passwords\nPolicy\nStrong passwords should be used for access to any company accounts and services. We recommend creating passwords with a minimum of 16 characters and a combination of alphabetic, numeric and special characters.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.\nCompliance\nAll employees and contractors are expected to create strong passwords for access to all Lullabot and client accounts.\nExplanation and Implementation\nThe first layer of defense that we have for our online accounts is the PIN, passcode, or password. As such, it is extremely important to use good, unique passwords, and keep them well protected. A good password consists of a fully random string, the longer the better. Contrary to popular belief, the inclusion of numbers, characters, or mixed case does not matter nearly as much as the length of the password itself.\nBecause the human brain is not capable of remembering long random passwords, we need the help of some sort of tool, like a Password Manager.\nNow that you are using one of these tools (right?), it is important to make sure that you are not using the same password on multiple services. Consider the event that one of these sites has its security compromised, and your username/password are discovered. Now, how many other places use that same combination? Are some of those important? Like maybe your email or bank accounts? This is why it is so important to use different passwords for different services.\nAlso, because you are now using one of these convenient tools, and would not be able to remember your passwords if you wanted to anyway, you might as well make them all super-secure. The length of a password is its primary strength. The longer it is, the stronger it is. These days, most security experts suggest passwords of 12-16 characters, minimum. But what does it matter to you if you are using copy/paste anyway? Crank those suckers up to 32 characters and be safe for the next millennium.\nFinally, you should be wary of services that impose password limits, especially if they limit the length of the password. Any service that cares even a little about your security will store passwords using a well salted, secure hash which makes any password, regardless of length fit into a common length string. There is no excuse for a service to tell you that your password cannot be longer than 16 characters. If they do, they are most likely storing passwords insecurely, and if that is true, what other security protocols might they be skimping on?\n"},"access/password_managers.html":{"url":"access/password_managers.html","title":"Password Managers","keywords":"","body":"Password Managers\nPolicy\nThe use of a password manager is strongly encouraged.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.\nCompliance\nThere will be more requirements for long passwords, and potentially more requirements to change them. It is expected that users will require the convenience of a password manager to manage them.\nExplanation and Implementation\nA password manager, like 1Password, helps store and organize your passwords. With a password manager you can manage dozens of strong and unique passwords without any need to remember every one of them. Password managers store passwords encrypted. The encrypted passwords are protected by a master password, a single, very strong password which grants the user access to their entire password database. This master password could be a phrase instead of a single word to make it longer and harder to guess.\nSome password managers include a password generator that can automatically generate very strong passwords for each of your accounts. This makes it easier to create the long, complex passwords that keep your accounts safe.\nMany password managers make it possible to share passwords across devices, so you could store the passwords once, then use them on your computer, your tablet, and your phone. Many also include provisions to share passwords with colleagues or family members. Additionally, they often include features like 'secure notes' where you can store other information securely, like fallback passcodes for accounts that were set up using two factor authentication.\nA password manager can compare the current site's URL to the stored site's URL. If the two don't match then the password manager should not automatically fill in the login fields. This would be a safeguard against visual imitations and look-alike websites. Many of the better password managers handle multi-page fill-ins, and multi-factor authentication as well.\nIn contrast to password managers, there are more simple password syncing services built into most common web browsers, like iCloud keychain and Chrome's built-in password management. These services store passwords, and may sync them across devices, but they're browser-specific, and they don't have additional features like password generators. In fact, if you are using a password manager, you don't need password syncing, and you could disable these services and delete their stored passwords to avoid potential confusion from having multiple services storing passwords and trying to auto-populate your password fields.\n"},"access/two_factor_authentication.html":{"url":"access/two_factor_authentication.html","title":"Two Factor Authentication","keywords":"","body":"Two-factor Authentication (2FA)\nPolicy\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is required for any account or service that supports it, if that service provides access to Lullabot or client information. This includes, but is not limited to, Gmail, GitHub, Dropbox, and Slack. Lullabot employees and contractors will need to set up 2FA to log into these accounts.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.\nCompliance\n\nNo less than once a year, all accounts and services that provide access to Lullabot or client information will be reviewed to determine if 2FA is available, and, if so, ensure the service has been configured to require 2FA.\nWhen new accounts or services are added, they will be configured to require 2FA, if 2FA is available.\n\nExplanation and Implementation\nTraditional authentication consists of a username and password. However, there is a more secure way to authenticate, called two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication consists of something you know (a username and password) combined with a code available from something you have. The \"something you have\" is usually another device, like your phone.\nWhen logging into an account that has been set up with two factor authentication, you will be asked for your username and password as usual, but you will also be asked for the current PIN. \nThere are several ways to generate this PIN. It could be sent to the phone as a text message or email. Or you could install an authentication app. Examples of authentication apps are Google Authenticator or Authy.\nWhen an authentication app is linked to your account, the app will display a six digit PIN that changes \nonce every minute. Using an app is great for those moments where your laptop has internet access but your phone doesn't have a signal to get a text message.\nTwo-factor authentication is significantly more secure than single-factor (username and password only). If someone figures out your single-factor authentication credentials, they can access your account indefinitely without you knowing, or worse, log in and change your password to lock you out. With two-factor\nauthentication, there is a time-based token that they would need to know, too, and it continuously changes. This keeps your account much more secure.\nYou should be sure you have some way to recover access to your account if your phone is lost or destroyed. Most Lullabot-run accounts can be reset by an admin, but it can be problematic for personal accounts or smaller services without group or company features. An easy way to think about it is to think about how you would recover from a (local) disaster like a fire or flood. If you lost every piece of technology you owned, could you recover your accounts? Some strategies include:\n\nGoogle lets you specify multiple recovery phone numbers. Set up SMS fallbacks to your own phone or to another trusted person. You can always get a new phone or SIM card for your own number. PINs sent to other numbers won't compromise your accounts unless they also know your logins and passwords.\nThe Authy app provides an option to share codes across devices. This would allow you to retrieve your code from some other device that has the app installed.\nPrint out 2FA recovery codes and store them securely outside of your house. \nStore recovery codes in the notes field in 1Password if it's accessible from multiple devices. However, if you choose to optionally enable 2FA for 1Password itself, store a hard copy of the recovery codes securely.\nDetermine if the service will let you recover an account with proper government ID. For example, Linode will do this, while GitHub will not.\nDetermine if an account can be reset by an account admin - Google Apps accounts can do this, while GitHub and others can not.\nDo not store recovery codes in unencrypted services like Dropbox or iCloud.\n\n"},"access/shared_passwords.html":{"url":"access/shared_passwords.html","title":"Shared Passwords","keywords":"","body":"Shared Passwords\nPolicy\nShared passwords shall be managed in a central application, where access can be monitored and passwords can be easily changed.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees.\nCompliance\n\nShared passwords will be managed using LastPass Enterprise shared folders.\nSeparate shared folders will be created for groups of passwords that should allow access to the same group of people. Permission will then be set at the group level.\nShared passwords will be changed whenever employees leave Lullabot, or if there is any reason to be concerned that shared passwords may have been compromised.\n\nExplanation and Implementation\nLastPass Enterprise has many advantages for managing shared passwords:\n\nProvides easy access to a password manager that can be used for other passwords.\nLinking a free personal LastPass account gives it all the features of a premium account via the enterprise license.\nThis does not change anything for non-LastPass users, just where they find the shared password.\nLastPass does not have access to our passwords.\nThe LastPass plugin works in Safari.\nLastPass is decentralized. If LastPass goes offline, we can still access our vaults locally.\nLastPass has SAML options, that would allow auto-login to many services we already use, like Yammer, Slack, Google, Expensify, Dropbox, many more.\nLastPass has group-based sharing permissions.\nLastPass provides an analysis of password strength.\nLastPass has event logging, which will show who accessed/changed a password, when, and from where.\nPasswords are accessible with no software installation.\nLastPass supports a variety of 2FA options.\n\nUsers of other password managers probably want to make a few adjustments if they want to continue using their own password manager for their personal accounts:\n\nConsider using separate browsers for work and personal.\nConsider using web-access to LastPass instead of the extension.\nMay be able to configure LastPass to not ask about saving passwords.\n\nRecommendations for users\nDon’t put non-shared passwords in your Lullabot vault, create a personal account and link it to the shared account.\n\nThis is even LastPass’s official recommendation.\nThere is a policy where we can officially recommend/require this.\nAdmins can reset/lock the Lullabot vault, and ultimately can get access to its contents.\nTermination from Lullabot will at least result in loss of access to your Lullabot vault, and at most will result in irrecoverable loss of the data in the vault.\nIf you already have a LastPass account using your lullabot.com email address, change it to a personal email address before accepting the enterprise invite.\nIf you use another password manager for personal accounts, you'll still want to create a personal LastPass account and link it so personal passwords don't accidentally get added to the shared accounts.\n\n"},"access/shared_accounts.html":{"url":"access/shared_accounts.html","title":"Shared Accounts","keywords":"","body":"Shared Accounts\nPolicy\nShared accounts will not be used on systems that have the capability for individual user accounts.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.\nCompliance\n\nIndividual accounts will be used for all services that support them.\nIf a service does not support multiple accounts, access credentials will be stored in the shared password manager with access only granted to the users who need it.\nWritten confirmation from a client is required if the client requires use of a shared account in a service they manage.\nWhen comparing multiple services, services that support individual accounts will be preferred over those that do not.\nInvitations to services should be sent by email address, and not user name, to avoid inviting wrong members to a team.\n\nExplanation and Implementation\nWhile shared accounts offer simplicity compared to maintaining individual accounts, they make other security objectives difficult or impossible to meet. Shared accounts:\n\nDo not identify individual owners of work products.\nDo not provide an audit log that allows relating an action to a named individual.\nDo not allow for offboarding of a team member without rotating and redistributing credentials.\nDo not allow for proper notifications in communication tools, such as mentions in issues or tickets.\n\nMost services aimed at teams offer per-user accounts, such as GitHub, Drupal.org, and Jira. However, \"infrastructure\" services such as domain registrars often only support a single account.\nSome services, like GitHub, allow for a single identity to have multiple attached email addresses, such as a personal and a work email. Team members may use existing personal accounts for services like these, however they must attach a Lullabot email address to the account.

While each situation will be judged on a case-by-case basis, employees should be aware that consequences may include the termination of their employment.\nUse of any of Lullabot’s resources for any illegal activity will usually be grounds for summary dismissal, and Lullabot will not hesitate to cooperate with any criminal investigation and prosecution that may result from such activity.\nAcceptable Use\nLullabot’s systems exist to support and enable the business. Personal use is allowed. However it must not be in any way detrimental to users own or their colleagues productivity and nor should it result in any direct costs being borne by Lullabot other than for trivial amounts.\nAny information that is particularly sensitive or vulnerable must be encrypted and/or securely stored so that unauthorized access is prevented (or at least made extremely difficult). However this must be done in a way that does not prevent–or risk preventing–legitimate access by all properly-authorized parties.\nLullabot can monitor the use of its IT systems and the data on it at any time. This may include (except where precluded by local privacy laws) examination of the content stored within the email and data files of any user, and examination of the access history of any users.\nLullabot reserves the right to regularly audit networks and systems to ensure compliance with this policy.\nUsers must take all necessary steps to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information. Users are expected to exercise reasonable personal judgment when deciding which information is confidential.\nUsers must not send, upload, remove on portable media or otherwise transfer to a non-Lullabot system any information that is designated as confidential, or that they should reasonably regard as being confidential to Lullabot, except where explicitly authorized to do so in the performance of their regular duties.\nUsers must keep passwords secure and not allow others to access their accounts. Users must ensure all passwords comply with Lullabot’s safe password policy.\nUsers are responsible for the safety and care of electronic equipment, and the security of software and data stored it and on other Lullabot systems that they can access remotely using it.\nBecause information on portable devices, such as laptops, tablets and smartphones, is especially vulnerable, special care should be exercised with these devices, including encrypting computers, and using strong and secure passwords and pins. Users will be held responsible for the consequences of theft of or disclosure of information on portable systems entrusted to their care if they have not taken reasonable precautions to secure it.\nAll workstations (desktops and laptops) should be secured with a lock-on-idle policy active after at most 10 minutes of inactivity. In addition, the screen and keyboard should be manually locked by the responsible user whenever leaving the machine unattended.\nUsers who have been charged with the management of those systems are responsible for ensuring that they are at all times properly protected against known threats and vulnerabilities as far as is reasonably practicable and compatible with the designated purpose of those systems.\nUsers must at all times guard against the risk of malware (e.g., viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, rootkits, worms, backdoors) being imported into Lullabot’s systems using best practices for the operating system in use, and must report any actual or suspected malware infection immediately.\nUnacceptable Use\nAll employees should use their own judgment regarding what is unacceptable use of Lullabot’s systems. The activities below are provided as examples of unacceptable use, however it is not exhaustive. Should an employee need to contravene these guidelines in order to perform their role, they should consult with and obtain approval from their manager before proceeding.\n\nAll illegal activities. These include theft, computer hacking, malware distribution, contravening copyrights and patents, and using illegal or unlicensed software or services.  These also include activities that contravene data protection regulations.\nAll activities detrimental to the success of Lullabot.  These include sharing sensitive information outside the company, such as research and development information and customer lists, as well as defamation of the company.\nAll activities that are inappropriate for Lullabot to be associated with and/or are detrimental to the company’s reputation. This includes pornography, gambling, inciting hate, bullying and harassment.\nCircumventing the IT security systems and protocols which Lullabot has put in place.\n\n"},"physical/locking.html":{"url":"physical/locking.html","title":"Device Lock Screens","keywords":"","body":"Device Lock Screens\nPolicy\nDevice lock screens should be configured to prevent access by unauthorized users, or when lost or stolen.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.\nCompliance\nAll Lullabot employees and contractors are required to protect all devices in their possession that have configurable locking options.\nExplanation and Implementation\nThe pins or passwords used to unlock devices deserve special mention.

While we're insured for this type of data loss by our Technology Errors and Omissions insurance we should do everything in our power to make sure data loss is never an issue we have to confront. One of the most important steps you can take is the encryption of your hard drive. This ensures that if your computer is lost or stolen, the thieves will be unable to access the information stored there. There's a fantastic write-up on the DR documenting the set up process for Mac users, which is most of us. If you're on Linux or Windows, please consider taking similar measures with any client data. Note that Bootcamp on Macs does not support disk encryption at all. If you must use Bootcamp for Lullabot work, create an encrypted disk image with BitLocker or Veracrypt and install portable apps to keep the data secure.\n"},"physical/backups.html":{"url":"physical/backups.html","title":"Backups","keywords":"","body":"Backups\nPolicy\nAll computers must be backed up regularly, and backups must be encrypted.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.\nCompliance\nAll Lullabot employees and contractors are responsible for backing up any machines in their possession.\nExplanation and Implementation\nBackups are by far the most overlooked or ignored, and arguably one of the most important parts of a computer system. They are overlooked because they are boring and provide no immediate benefit. But, when disaster hits it is too late. If you do not have backups then you are in trouble.\nThere are multiple levels of backups, each with their own merits and costs. These levels range from keeping a copy of a file in a different folder on your computer all the way up to fully automated, full disk backups to the Cloud. Which level is appropriate depends on the data in the backup, and ultimately how you answer the following question:\nWhat would I do if my working copy of this data disappeared?\nFor many of us at Lullabot, much of our work lives on GitHub, Google Drive, Dropbox, or some other online service. In this case, our answer might be \"I would download a new copy\" or \"I would revert to a previous revision\" or \"I would contact service X and ask them to restore the data\" and that might be enough. Nevertheless, in the likely case that this is not enough, a backup strategy is in order.\nTime Machine on macOS makes automated backups very easy with an external hard drive. This should really be considered the baseline backup level for your computer. Turn on Time Machine, and for the\nmost part just forget about it and let it run. Even if most of your work is online, having Time Machine backups makes replacing a machine a much easier task. Instead of spending hours reinstalling applications and setting up preferences, you can start the restore process and come back to a ready-to-use machine.\nRemember, it’s important to enable encryption for your Time Machine backups, just as you do with your hard drive. This is enabled by default in recent macOS releases. If for some reason encryption is disabled, you can enable it with:\n\nGo to System Preferences >> Time Machine\nSelect “Stop using  for backups”\nThen “re-add” and when you do, select “encrypt backups”\n\nNow that you feel all warm and fuzzy about being protected from accidental data loss on your computer, think about what you would do if both your computer and your backup device were stolen or destroyed in a fire, flood, or worse? What would you do? Could you get a new computer and get back to work? Probably\nto some degree, but would you be missing some important files? Most likely.\nA second layer of backups to an off-site location is the only way to protect yourself from this type of data loss. There are different ways to approach this problem, too, such as shipping a copy of your Time Machine volume to your parents every so often, or finding a friend to host an FTP server that you can dump files to every so often. These strategies are not wrong, but there are more practical solutions involving cloud storage. The simplest solution would be to store all of your important items in a Dropbox folder, though Dropbox is not a real backup solution. You could subscribe to a cloud backup service, but note that most services like Backblaze and Carbonite don't have appropriate encryption support for Lullabot data. These services are relatively cheap and may prove an important form of insurance. For a cheaper but slightly more complicated option, consider setting up Amazon Glacier storage with Arq for your encrypted backups. Reach out to the team in on Slack in #apple, #linux, or #windows to find out about current tools and best practices.\n"},"physical/lost-devices.html":{"url":"physical/lost-devices.html","title":"Lost or Stolen Devices","keywords":"","body":"Lost or Stolen Devices\nPolicy\nReasonable steps should be taken to ensure that devices that contain or provide access to Lullabot information won't be compromised if lost or stolen.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.\nCompliance\nEncryption and secure screen lock pins are the first line of defense against compromised security from lost or stolen devices. 'Find my [phone|computer]', and remote wipe features can also be enabled for additional protection.\nExplanation and Implementation\nWhat happens if your device is lost or stolen? The best scenario is where you can recover it and ensure that no one else could have accessed data on it, since you have a screen lock and encrypted your disk. The next best is where you can recover your device, without knowing if anyone accessed or changed files on it. For example, if your disk isn't encrypted, someone could have easily installed a keylogger to siphon off passwords. The worst scenario is where you completely lose an unencrypted device. In that case, you should assume everything is compromised and start resetting and recovering accounts.\nTo prevent problems:\n\nMake sure all computers and phones have encryption enabled.\nCreate secure pins and passwords for device screen locks.\nEnable Find My Phone|Computer features, where available. For Apple devices, at least, this includes options to remotely wipe a lost or stolen device.\nConsider adding contact information to your lock screen to make it easier for someone who finds your device to return it.\nConsider enabling the emergency contact info on your phone. \n\nAlso make sure that you have strong passwords for any accounts that can remotely wipe devices. Individuals have been targeted by remote wiping their devices through weak iCloud passwords, making it very difficult to recover accounts.\nAndroid Devices\nAndroid Device Manager is the easiest way to find and manage Android devices. Your phone manufacturer (Samsung, Motorola, etc) may also have device recovery software you can use. ADM lets you locate, ring, and erase devices. You can also set up a new lock screen code.\nIt's also a good idea to put contact information on your phone's lock screen. In Android 5, it's under Settings -> Security -> Owner info, and is available in older Android versions as well. Make sure your contact info isn't only accessible on your phone!\niOS and Mac Devices\nFor an Apple device, there's a handy tracking utility that can help you either locate the lost device, or, in the event of a theft, wipe the device's memory so that your data is safe. Part of the iCloud services offered by Apple includes the \"Find My iPhone\" app available for iOS devices and on MacOS.\nOn iOS, visit Settings >> iCloud and make sure you turn on \"Find My iPhone\". Next, download the Find iPhone app that's free from the app store so you can view your devices on a map. This app will also allow you to remotely wipe a device that is no longer safely in your possession. If your device is stolen, you may also be able to see where the thief has taken it.\nOn the Mac, go to System Preferences >> iCloud and make sure you enable the \"Find my Mac\" option so that your desktop machine will also be protected in this manner.\nThe Apple support site has more information about how to use Find My Phone and Find My Mac features.\nOn both iOS and OS X you can put contact info on the lock screen. For OS X, it's under \"Security & Privacy\" in System Preferences. Make sure your phone number or email isn't only accessible on your phone!\nOn iOS you can use an app to burn info into an image. If the phone is lost you can also display contact information on the lock screen of the lost device using the \"Find My iPhone\" screen in iCloud. \nAdd emergency contact info to your phone\nFinally, you can add emergency contact information to your phone. Emergency information is accessible on a locked device, and will provide an additional way for someone to find the owner of a device.\nWhat to do when you've lost a device\nFiguring out appropriate next steps for this can be pretty complicated. As well, being distributed makes us an easier target for impersonation attacks. We should assume we are not concerned about nation-state level attacks; if Chinese sponsored attackers try to get into a client (think Sony and North Korea) through us, we're probably subject to zero-days and the like.\nFinding your lost device is the first step to figuring out how much you need to do to make sure everything remains secure.\nIs there a realistic security issue, or just a lost device?\nThe first step is to figure out if it's reasonably possible for someone to get access to accounts and data from the lost device. Laptop drives are accessible if they aren't encrypted. Encrypted devices are accessible if they aren't locked. If a laptop is stolen and we can't know if it was locked, we should assume the contents are open to the world, as all it takes is a (cheap) USB device to keep it awake. If someone isn't sure, they should reach out to the hive-mind for advice. A smart attacker will also keep LastPass or 1Password unlocked.\nYou lost a device that was encrypted and locked or off:\nYou probably don't need to do anything security-wise other than letting the team know you lost your device.\nYou lost a device that might have been unlocked, but you store passwords in a password manager that was known to be locked:\nYou don't need to reset passwords or credentials except for anything that might be in plain text. If you have apps that don't use the OS X keychain, you might need to reset those credentials. Windows and Linux apps commonly store passwords in clear-text (or mildly obfuscated) on disk. API tokens should be reset, like those used by Composer for GitHub access or those stored in settings.php in client sites.\nIf you get your device back, assume it's been compromised with a keylogger. Wipe it and restore it from a known-good backup. This includes ignoring any potential cloud backups made since you lost the device.\nYou lost a device without encryption (a Windows laptop, a Time Machine backup drive, an Android phone)\nPost to Yammer to let the team know you lost a device. The team should take this as a note to be on guard for suspicious activity. If you lost all your devices, call 1-877-LULLABOT or your manager.\nGet on a phone or video call with a member of the admin team to confirm the lost device. Managers and the admin team should not accept text communication as proof that they are communicating with an employee. Confirm with them what accounts you need them to reset. They should be able to reset passwords quickly for Lullabot-managed accounts like Google Apps and the Daily Report. If warranted, the admin team should send an email to team@lullabot.com alerting the company about the lost device.\nAfter regaining access to your Lullabot email address, use it to reset passwords for accounts to log out all active sessions. Some services will let you log in, list, and kill active sessions, saving you from having to reset your password.\nHigh-profile services to have an admin team member immediately reset or log out all sessions if you can't do it yourself:\n\nGoogle\nDaily Report / LDAP\nBamboo HR\nLinode Manager\nSlack\nYammer\nNoko\n\nServices individuals need to reset or log out on their own once the above is done:\n\nGitHub\nClient-specific services (like Jira, Hipchat, etc)\nDrupal.org\nTwitter, Facebook, etc\n\nCommonly forgotten items:\n\nAPI keys for services in code\nPasswordless SSH Keys\nBackup services like CrashPlan, Carbonite, and so on\n\nData loss and client notifications\nTalk with your manager to figure out what actions are appropriate for any client code or databases on your device. Remember to consider past clients who you might not be actively working for at the moment. If there were database dumps on your machine that weren't encrypted or sanitized, follow the same steps as if a production or development environment had been compromised. Deleted files can still be recovered from unencrypted drives.\n"},"physical/malware.html":{"url":"physical/malware.html","title":"Malware and Viruses","keywords":"","body":"Malware and Viruses\nPolicy\nLullabot employees and contractors are expected to adhere to best practices for avoiding malware and viruses. \nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.\nCompliance\nEach employee or contractor will be responsible for their own equipment.\nExplanation and Implementation\nProtection against malware and viruses includes, but is not limited to:\n\nAvoid installing unlicensed software, pirated music, video, software, these can be a vector for malware.\nProtect devices from malware and viruses by enabling the firewall and using virus protection software.\nUse an ad-blocker.

Feel free to customize settings, but it's not required. The toolbar button can be used to disable blocking on a per-site basis, which is useful when working on client sites or visiting sites that have committed to auditing and securing their ads.\nFor further security and control, consider using an extension like NoScript or Ghostery.\nRansomware\nLullabot employees and contractors should watch for ransomware attacks, as companies are often targeted by such scams. Ransomware is a specialized variant of malware, where documents and data are encrypted using strong cryptography. Then, the malware will attempt to extort a fee for a \"recovery key\" out of the business. Ransomware is distributed through a variety of means, including compromised websites and advertising servers or email. Most Ransomware will attempt to encrypt all accessible documents, including those on network or external drives.\nLullabot has a general policy of not paying attackers to unlock files. Instead, we treat ransomware just like any other disk failure. If you are infected with ransomware, wipe your disks and recover your data from backups and from the cloud.\nThe following types of backups may be at risk from a ransomware infection.\n\nTime Machine backup disks: Employees should have a second backup system (such as an off-site cloud backup) that protects their data if the Time Machine backup is unusable. This second backup should not be \"mountable\" as a normal file system, and should have it's own server-side versioning to protect data.\nFiles synced to your computer from cloud services: This includes services such as Dropbox, iCloud, and Google Drive. We rely on Dropbox's restore features to protect these files.\nNetwork drives: NAS appliances should have snapshots and off-site backups. For example, a Synology NAS with BTRFS protects against ransomware from a network mount by not exposing the snapshots to network users.\n\nSource code is typically not vulnerable to ransomware as server-side version control (like Git) protects the code.\n"},"physical/device.html":{"url":"physical/device.html","title":"Device Maintenance","keywords":"","body":"Device Maintenance\nPolicy\nLullabot employees are expected to adhere to best practices for maintaining any devices in their possession. \nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees.\nCompliance\nEach employee will be responsible for their own equipment.\nExplanation and Implementation\nBest practices for maintenance of electronic equipment includes, but is not limited to:\n\nUse surge protectors.\nEnable the firewall.\nProcure insurance to cover potential equipment loss or damage.\nMaintain a regular backup schedule.\nRemove or disable the guest account on a laptop.\nDisable options to share the hard drive.\nConsider using a separate router and SSID for personal and IoT network connections.\n\nUnlicensed software, pirated music, video, software are not permitted on Lullabot laptops, these can be a vector for malware.

However, the use of insecure cloud services can introduce unintended risk to you, your coworkers, and the company. We want to balance the security of our content, networks and applications with the ability to work in a flexible, productive environment. \nWhat is a cloud service?\nWe consider a cloud service to be any software as a service application that is hosted by the software vendor. The Google Suite, Dropbox, and Noko are all cloud services. As a distributed company working with many clients, cloud services make our business possible in the first place.\nSome applications may not seem like cloud services, but use the cloud for sync and storage. For example, Apple Music is a cloud service, even though it’s only accessed through iTunes and not a web browser.\nWhat needs to be done to introduce a new cloud service at Lullabot?\nRead the following, and then fill out the service request form.\nIf a new cloud service is purchased individually on PEX, and it does not require integration or access to Lullabot data stored in other services, no specific approval is required. Examples of services like this include:\n\nEvernote\nArq Cloud Backup\nMicrosoft Office 365\n\nBe wary of applications that use your Lullabot account to access key personal data like email, especially if they are free or are low cost.\nApps that integrate with services used by the Lullabot team or interact with Lullabot customers should be discussed with the relevant directors and also need review by the security committee. Since these services are used by multiple team members, and not individuals, they typically are charged to a Lullabot expense card or are invoiced. Examples of services like this include:\n\nGeekbot, as it requires integration with our Slack instance.\nDrift, as it interacts with Lullabot customers and gathers their personal information.\nCircleCI, as it has access to customer owned source code.\n\nWhere possible, clients should be the account owner of cloud services in client engagements. While the security committee can provide feedback, the client should be primarily responsible for how they want to handle security reviews, if any.\nWhen do I use my Lullabot email and when do I use my personal email when signing up for Cloud services?\n\nIf you are signing up for a service paid for by Lullabot, or a Lullabot client, use the Lullabot email address.\nIf you are signing up for a service at the request of Lullabot, or a Lullabot client, use the Lullabot email address.\nIf you are signing up for a service that will contain or provide access to Lullabot data, or Lullabot client data, use the Lullabot email address.\nIf you are signing up for a service that you would continue to use even if you were no longer employed at Lullabot, use your personal email address.\nIf you are signing up for a service that will not contain or provide access to Lullabot data, nor be used by others at Lullabot or Lullabot clients, use your personal email address.\n\nIf a service supports multiple email addresses per account, it’s OK (and even recommended) to use one “account” with multiple “identities”. GitHub is the most notable example of this, though services that are built on top of GitHub likely use the same model. For example, instead of creating a new account, add your Lullabot email address to your existing account. Use the built-in tools to associate work and personal email addresses with the right organizations and projects.\nSome clients will create email addresses for you. Where possible, use your Lullabot email address instead of a client email address. This is especially important for VPN recovery, where client email may not be accessible outside of the VPN. Consider redirecting your client email to your Lullabot email if it’s supported by the client.\nThere are times when the answers might conflict, and you could make a case for using either email address. When in doubt communicate with your manager or the security team for instructions.\nWhat if there are both personal and business versions of a cloud service?\nMany cloud services used by Lullabot include provisions to store both business and personal information. For instance, there is a Lullabot Dropbox account, but you can also establish a personal Dropbox account and link them together. Our 1Password Business membership includes a free 1Password Families membership for each employee.\nAny time there is an option to separate personal and business data in the cloud, we require employees to respect that separation. Don’t put Lullabot data, or Lullabot client data, into your personal account, nor add personal information into the Lullabot account. Lullabot won’t ever have access to your personal account, so nothing that belongs to the company or its clients should go into it. The test for whether you have separated your personal data properly is to confirm that if you were to unexpectedly lose access to the Lullabot account, you would still retain all your own personal data.\nSome services, like iCloud, provide no easy way to separate business and personal data. Since company data is involved, we require that you use best security practices to protect all the data stored in these systems. These best practices include storing the data in encrypted format, and using encryption when transferring data by using HTTPS and the VPN as appropriate.\nHow do I know it’s safe to use a cloud service?\nThe security team follows these guidelines when evaluating a new service. For example, when we investigated using Bamboo HR for Lullabot, we reviewed their Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and any Security Policies. Examples of what was checked include:\n\nTheir site HTTPs configuration with SSL Labs\nTheir policies for data encryption and backup\nTheir policies for who at BambooHR had access to our HR data\nTheir password and password recovery policies (such as, do they limit passwords to 12 characters, or only allow letters and numbers)\nTheir account and data deletion policies\nTheir security reporting and notification practices\n\nA search for “breach” or “leak” is also a good test to see if a service has a record of poor security. Instead of just investigating if a given service was breached, investigate how they handled the breach and how their systems were designed. For example, Yahoo has been shown to have a poor security track record, storing personal data and passwords in a way that made it easy for attackers to exploit.\nConsider the type of data you are using the cloud service for. If all they have is your name and email address, the risk is pretty low. Don’t use client data when trying out a new service, so if it does turn out to be insecure, the breach is limited. This also applies to service access tokens and API keys (e.g. a Pantheon Terminus token or a GitHub API key). These should not be used with cloud services such as hosted development environments like GitPod. Tokens can be added to CI services, but they should be as tightly scoped as possible and not allow cross-client access. For example, don't generate a Pantheon access token from your personal user account which has access to multiple clients. Instead, create a bot user for that specific project and tie all tokens to the bot.\nIn general, the security team aims to provide feedback on possible issues to the relevant stakeholders, rather than acting as a blocker to new services. We may ask those requesting new services to help with the investigation.

Employees and contractors will be encouraged to use the email lists for all client communications. Employees and contractors will remove copies of the emails contained on their computers at the end of a project, so that the archived emails under the control of the company serve as the only remaining copies of those messages.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and management.\nCompliance\n\nProject or account managers will notify administrative staff when projects are initiated and when the projects end so the email groups can be created and decommissioned.\nAdministrative staff will periodically review email groups to identify any that should be decommissioned, and do so.\n\nExplanation and Implementation\nEmail with clients often contains sensitive information, so it must be carefully controlled. Email, by its nature, is difficult to control, since copies will be stored locally for every participant in the email message.\nTo better control this information, the company will create an email list for each client project and encourage employees, contractors, and clients to send email to that list when communicating about the project. The members of that list will include the staff members assigned to that project and relevant management representatives, like the account manager.\nAt the conclusion of a project, the email group will be decommissioned. The process of decommissioning the group will consist of:\n\nSending a final email to all members of the group announcing that the group is being decommissioned and asking them to remove any copies of those emails that they have on their own computers.\nRemoving all members from the group.\nRemoving the option to post to the group.\nRenaming the group to a name that begins with 'ZZZ' to sort the decommissioned groups to the bottom of group lists.\n\nAt the conclusion of this process, management will still have a copy of all the messages in the group, should it be needed in the future, but all other copies of the messages in the possession of company employees and contractors should be deleted.\nThere will be additional benefits from directing all communications through the designated email group. Clients can easily communicate with the team without knowing every member's individual email address. In addition, new team members can be added into the group at any time, and they will have the ability to review prior communications with the client.\n"},"communications/slack.html":{"url":"communications/slack.html","title":"Slack Channels","keywords":"","body":"Slack Channels\nPolicy\nSlack is an application used for everyday communications in Lullabot. Slack consists of a collection of channels that include a general channel and channels specific to a topic, project, or client. When these channels are no longer required, they should be archived, but not deleted.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Lullabot employees and management.\nCompliance\n\nThe person who created the Slack channel will also be responsible for archiving it when no longer needed. \nAdmin staff will perform a periodic review of Slack channels to identify channels that have no activity as potential candidates for archival, and contact the channel creator to confirm the course of action.\nIf a client or colleague from another organization needs access to a Slack channel:\nand they also use Slack at their organization, they will be added through the Shared Channel feature.\nor if they do not use Slack as a part of their organization, then they'll be added using the Guest Account feature.\nGuest accounts will be set to expire in 12 months, and renewed for additional 6 month periods as needed.\n\n\n\nExplanation and Implementation\nSlack channels can be created for specific projects and clients. These channels keep a lot of noise out of the general channel and also provide a place to talk specifically about a topic or client. Non-employees may be invited to these channels as well, allowing clients and contractors to communicate about a specific project without allowing them access to the general Lullabot channel. \nThe sheer number of channels makes it hard for anyone to see all the available channels and choose to join the right ones. Therefore it's useful to remove channels once the client project is finished or the topic is no longer a priority. Unneeded Slack channels can either be deleted or archived. If deleted, all communication from that channel will be lost. If archived, the communication is preserved, but the channel drops out of the list of active channels. Another advantage of archiving is that it is easy to re-activate the channel in Slack and immediately have access to the history.\nMany of these Slack channels might contain sensitive or important client or project information. It's not always obvious ahead of time which information might be useful in the future. To be safe, unneeded channels should be archived, not deleted.\nYou can view archived channels to see or reactivate them. There are instructions in Slack about How to archive a channel. Note that private channels cannot be archived. They must be made public first, then archived.\n"},"communications/gpg.html":{"url":"communications/gpg.html","title":"Using PGP/GPG for Secure Communications","keywords":"","body":"Using PGP/GPG for Secure Communications\nThe original program, Pretty Good Privacy, eventually became a standard called OpenPGP. GNU PGP, or \"GPG\", is the most widely used PGP implementation, but for simplicity this document refers to to \"PGP\".\nPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a system that lets people communicate with each other securely online. PGP lets you sign emails and files so others can be sure they haven't been modified and are actually from you. You can also use PGP to encrypt emails and files so only the intended recipients can view them. Why would you want a PGP key?\n\nYou can sign emails you send and receive encrypted email without needing to pay for a certificate. Great for passing around passwords and credentials.\nYou can sign and encrypt files that can be decrypted on any computer (unlike encrypted disk images that are tied to OS X). You could use PGP to encrypt a PDF of a sensitive HR form, and then the filled-out version could have a real digital signature on the returned copy.\nIf you're writing code, you can use git to sign commits and tags. That lets others verify not only that the code hasn't been modified, but that the commit by Sally Young is actually from Sally Young and not James Sansbury.\n\nWhat are the limitations of PGP?\n\nMany email programs don't support any encryption systems at all, and some that do only support the centralized S/MIME standard. Most desktop email clients have plugins to add PGP support, but mobile devices usually don't support plugins in their apps.\nUsing any sort of encryption or signing is difficult in webmail. Gmail can't search the contents of encrypted emails since Gmail doesn't have your decryption keys. There are browser plugins to add PGP support to Gmail on the web, but Gmail on Android and iOS don't support those plugins.\nWhen signing (and not encrypting) emails, recipients can get confused by the signature attachment added to the message. In general, don't sign emails to clients unless you know they are aware of PGP.\nFor someone to decrypt a file, they have to be set up with PGP. You can't just call them and give them a password. However, PGP is pretty much the only secure solution for file encryption that works on all operating systems.\n\nPGP uses a web of trust to help us validate keys and their owners. In the SSL certificate world, you pay Verisign or some other company to validate your identity. Often it's a basic email or phone call check. With PGP, Andrew can say \"I validated that PGP key ASDFXYZ belongs to Matt, because I saw him in person and looked at his drivers license\". If you then decide to trust Andrew's key, you'll automatically be able to trust Matt's key. This model works really well for companies like Lullabot, where we work mostly online but see each other in person a few times a year.\nCreating a PGP Key\nThese steps use GPG Tools for OS X. GPG also has a Windows version, and is available for All The Linuxes. Every PGP key has two halves: a public key that you share, and a private key that you keep to yourself. If someone else gets your private key (or the key on your hard drive plus your passphrase), they can pretend to be you and decrypt all your data. Treat your private keys like you would treat your banking or Google passwords.\nCreate a new key with GPG Keychain\nOpen GPG Keychain, and click the \"New\" button to create a key.  Enter your full name, and the email address you'd like to use. You can add additional email addresses later to the same key. Change the expiration date to one year from today. This value can be changed later, so set a calendar reminder to extend the expiration date of your key before that expiry date. If you lose your key, then this date will eventually kick in telling others not to use this key anymore. Enter a strong passphrase for the key. This should be one of the complicated passwords you do remember and commit to memory. Your computer login password isn't a bad idea, given that your passphrase will probably be stored in the OS X keychain. You can change this password later.  Click Generate key, have fun spamming your mouse or keyboard, and you will have a new PGP key!\nAdd additional emails to your key\nTo add more email addresses to your key, click Details, and then User IDs. If you have a different legal name from your given name, you can add those in here as well. \nAdding your picture to your key\nAdding a picture to your key gives yet another way to help validate your identity. PGP keys are shared as small text files, so you don't want to attach a 10MB JPEG to your key. For Lullabot employees and contractors, you can grab a pre-sized thumbnail from your user account edit form on lullabot.com.  Save this file, and then drag it in to the \"Photos\" tab on your key.\nUploading your public key\nNow that your key has been created, upload it to the public key directory. Any time you update your key's public data, remember to upload it again! \nGenerating a revocation certificate\nSometimes you might find yourself in a situation where you've lost control of your key. Perhaps you lost your laptop, or someone you don't trust was using it while you were logged in. A revocation certificate lets you tell the world that a key should no longer be used or trusted. GPG Tools for OS X will automatically store a revocation key for you, so as long as your computer is backed up it should always be possible to revoke a lost key.\nEncrypting a file\nOn OS X, right click a file, and \"OpenPGP: Encrypt\" will show up under the Services menu.  Choose who you want to be able to decrypt the file. In general, you will want to sign the file as well so the recipient knows it was you that sent it.  If you chose to sign the file or let yourself decrypt it, you will be asked for your passphrase and a \".gpg\" file will be created. This file can be emailed, shared on Dropbox, and so on, and it will be secure. There's a new \"Encrypt with password\" checkbox as well. That is useful for anyone who hasn't set up a public key yet. However, it still leaves you having to communicate that passphrase somehow. Try to use public keys instead because they are much easier to use once they are set up.\nDecrypting a file\nDouble click the .gpg file, and enter your passphrase. You might not be asked for your passphrase if you recently provided it. If the file was signed, and you have their public key in your keyring, GPG will tell you if it could validate who sent the file as well.\nKey Parties and the Web of Trust\nIf a gaggle of 'bots are getting together in the real world, it's a great chance to sign any new keys! Here's a condensed set of steps taken from The Keysigning Party HOWTO.\n\nEach person should create a key using the above steps.\nAfter, they should give the organizer the email attached to the key and the fingerprint of their key.\nThe organizer should import the key from the public server.\nFor the organizer, it's useful to create a separate keyring for the party to simplify creating a key list. gpg --keyring ~/Desktop/party.gpg --no-default-keyring --recv-keys [KEY-ID]\n\n\nThe organizer should then provide each person with a table of keys they can use to mark the ones they have validated.\n\nSigning a key\nOnce you have validated a key fingerprint belongs to a person, you can right-click on it and select \"Sign\". Uncheck the Signature Expires checkbox for anyone whose identity you are very confident in. For Lullabot employees and contractors, meeting in person should be enough to select \"I have done very careful checking\" since HR will have validated identities for employment. For others, check their driver's license or passport. Once the key is signed, upload it to a key server to tell the world about your trust in the identity.  If your key is signed by someone else, you can update your key from the public key servers to add the signature to your local copy of the key.\nValidating keys\nThe algorithm for the \"Validity\" field is somewhat complex. You might wonder why GPG isn't showing a key you think should be \"valid\" as valid. To paraphrase the GPG manual:\n\nKeys you personally sign will show as valid\nAt least three \"marginally trusted\" keys need to sign a key for it to be fully trusted\nThe \"ownertrust\" setting or dropdown on a person's key describes how much you trust that person to validate other keys in your keyring.\n\nGPG tries to be very flexible, and allows you to configure how it determines if keys are trusted or not. For our purposes, we recommend that you leave the GPG settings at their defaults. If your key isn't showing up as valid to others, then the best solution is to get more 'bots to sign your key. If other keys aren't showing up as valid for you, then you should find 'bots who's keys you can sign to bring them in to your Web of Trust.\n"},"appendix/appendix.html":{"url":"appendix/appendix.html","title":"Appendix","keywords":"","body":"Appendix\nThe appendix includes some checklists to help manage security.\n"},"appendix/links.html":{"url":"appendix/links.html","title":"Security Scams and Hacks","keywords":"","body":"Related Links\nThe items below link to stories on the web that have security ramifications.

The hacker reset his iCloud, Google, and Twitter passwords, remote-wiped his computer and phone, and then deleted his Google account. Lots of things went wrong in this story, but a couple of things that would have reduced the damage would have been to use strong passwords and 2FA on his Google and Apple accounts, and not to use his Apple email address (one he seldom checked) as the recovery address for his Google account.\nStealing Login Credentials From a Locked PC or Mac Just Got Easier\nThis story describes a way to access login credentials from a laptop computer, even if the computer is locked, by plugging a device into a USB port on the computer. This makes it clear that locking the device is not enough to protect it.
