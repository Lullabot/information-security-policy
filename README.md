# Lullabot Information Security Policy

It is Lullabotâ€™s policy that the information it manages shall be appropriately secured to protect against the consequences of breaches of confidentiality, failures of integrity or interruptions to the availability of that information. This information security policy provides management direction and support for information security across the organization. 

This policy has been approved by the organization and forms part of its policies and procedures. It is applicable to and will be communicated to staff and other relevant parties. This policy shall be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it remains appropriate in the light of any relevant changes to the law, organizational policies or contractual obligations.

An information security oversight committee, chaired by a senior officer, shall be established to manage information security within Lullabot. The objective of this group shall be to ensure that there is clear direction and visible management support for security initiatives. This group shall conduct a risk assessment to identify the probability and impact of security failures, and devise and coordinate the implementation of information security controls.

The organization will establish and maintain appropriate contacts with other organizations, law enforcement authorities, regulatory bodies, and network and telecommunications operators in respect of its information security policy.
