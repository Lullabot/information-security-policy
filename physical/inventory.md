## Device Inventory

### Policy
All computers and cell phones will be tracked in an inventory management system. 

### Scope
This policy applies to all Lullabot employees and management.

### Compliance
- Whenever a new computer or cell phone is purchased, details about the device will be entered into an inventory tracking system.
- Whenever a computer or cell phone is taken out of service it will be removed from the device tracking system.
- The system will track identifying information, including make, model, and serial number.
- The system will track the location of the item and identify the person who has possession of it.
- The system will include a classification system to allow each device to be classified based on its security risk.
- The system will create labels that can be attached to each device.

### Explanation and Implementation
Lullabot tracks devices in an inventory tracking system. All computers and cell phones used for Lullabot business will be tracked in this system, regardless of who purchased them or when they were purchased. 

#### PEX and Other Purchases
Whenever a computer or cell phone is purchased with PEX or Lullabot funds, details about the device will be entered into the inventory tracking system by administrative staff when they process the receipt. The purchaser can add the serial number and other information as a comment to the purchase in the PEX system. 

If the device is replacing an older piece of equipment, the older equipment should be removed from service at that time. The administrative staff will be responsible for determining when this should be done and following up with the person who has control of the older device.

#### Classification
Devices in the inventory tracking system will be classified into one of the following categories:

- Confidential (top confidentiality level)
- Restricted (medium confidentiality level)
- Internal use (lowest level of confidentiality)
- Public (everyone can see the information or the device provides no access to any information)

#### Labeling
A label will be created for each device that is tracked in the inventory tracking system. That label should be attached to the device.

#### Removing Devices From Service
Computers and cell phones that have been replaced, or those which are being sold to employees, should be properly removed from service.

- All Lullabot or client data should be removed from the device.
- All Lullabot and client passwords, pins, and password managers should be removed or emptied.
- If it's impossible to identify and separately remove such data, the device should be wiped and restored to factory defaults.
- Once sensitive information has been removed from the device, it should be deleted from the device inventory.

#### Device Inventory
Device inventories shall be conducted periodically. At that time details about computers not already in the device inventory system can be added, and computers no longer in service can be removed from the system.

An initial inventory shall be performed to collect an accounting of computers and cell phones purchased prior to the time when this policy was implmented.
