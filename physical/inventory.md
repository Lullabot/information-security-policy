# Asset Inventory

### Policy
All computers and cell phones will be tracked in an inventory management system. 

### Scope
This policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.

### Compliance
- Whenever a new computer or cell phone is purchased, details about the asset will be entered into Asset Panda.
- Whenever a computer or cell phone is taken out of service it will be removed from the asset tracking system.
- The system will track identifying information, including make, model, and serial number.
- The system will track the location of the item and identify the person who has possession of it.

### Explanation and Implementation
Lullabot uses Asset Panda to track assets and equipment. All computers and cell phones used for Lullabot business will be tracked in this system, regardless of who purchased them or when they were purchased. 

#### PEX and Other Purchases
Whenever a computer or cell phone is purchased with PEX or Lullabot funds, details about the asset will be entered into Asset Panda by administrative staff when they process the receipt. If the asset is replacing an older piece of equipment, the older equipment should be removed from service at that time.

#### Removing Assets From Service
Computers and cell phones that have been replaced, or those which are being sold to employees, should be properly removed from service.

- All Lullabot or client data should be removed from the device.
- All Lullabot and client passwords, pins, and password managers should be removed or emptied.
- If it's impossible to identify and separately remove such data, the device should be wiped and restored to factory defaults.
- Once sensitive information has been removed from the device, it should be deleted from the asset inventory.

#### Asset Inventory
Asset inventories shall be conducted periodically. At that time details about computers not already in the asset management system can be added, and computers no longer in service can be removed from the system.

An initial inventory shall be performed to collect an accounting of computers and cell phones purchased prior to the time when this policy was implmented.
