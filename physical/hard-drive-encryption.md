# Hard Drive Encryption

### Scope

### Compliance


### Explanation and Implementation

As a client services company, we often are forced to store sensitive client data such as user information or other proprietary commercial data. While we're insured for this type of data loss by our Technology Errors and Omissions insurance we should do everything in our power to make sure data loss is never an issue we have to confront. One of the most important steps you can take is the encryption of your hard drive. This ensures that if your computer is lost or stolen, the thieves will be unable to access the information stored there. There's a fantastic [write-up on the DR](https://dailyreport.lullabot.com/node/5703) documenting the set up process for Mac users, which is most of us. If you're on Linux or Windows, please consider taking similar measures with any client data.
