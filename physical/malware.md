## Malware and Viruses

### Policy
Lullabot employees and contractors are expected to adhere to best practices for avoiding malware and viruses. 

### Scope
This policy applies to all Lullabot employees and contractors.

### Compliance
Each employee or contractor will be responsible for their own equipment.

### Explanation and Implementation

Protection against malware and viruses includes, but is not limited to:

- Avoid installing unlicensed software, pirated music, video, software, these can be a vector for malware.
- Protect devices from malware and viruses by enabling the firewall and using virus protection software.
- Use an ad-blocker. The business model for ad networks is contrary to best security practices, making them easy targets for hackers.
- Make Flash and Java click-to-play, Choose “Ask” rather than the default of “Allow” in Safari.
- Install ClamAV and have it scan folders with user uploaded data.

### Ad-blocker configuration

[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) is the most commonly used "content blocker" for web browsers. Chrome and Firefox are officially supported, and there are ports for other web browsers too.

#### Installation links

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/app/9nblggh444l4)
- [Safari](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari#ublock-originfor-safari)

The out-of-the-box configuration of uBlock is very good. Feel free to customize settings, but it's not required. The toolbar button can be used to disable blocking on a per-site basis, which is useful when working on client sites or visiting sites that have committed to auditing and securing their ads.

For further security and control, consider using an extension like [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) or [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com).
