## Email Security

### Policy
Employees and contractors should be aware of the security implications of email communication, for instance: 

- Users should be aware that email may not originate from the person it purports to come from and use care in responding to it.
- Sensitive information like passwords and IDs should not be communicated by email.
- Avoid sending sensitive files as email attachments.
- Share links to Dropbox should not be sent via email.

### Scope
This policy applies to Lullabot employees and contractors.

### Compliance
Each individual is expected to use caution in any email they initiate or receive, and help monitor and remind others of potential security vulnerabilities of any email threads they are included in.

### Explanation and Implementation

Avoid sending sensitive information in email, including:

- Passwords
- Server credentials
- Private keys
- Government issued IDs (Social Security numbers, etc.)
- Other private credentials or IDs

Secure methods for communicating sensitive credentials or information include:

- Create an initial password that must be changed immediately, enforced by the system.
- Verbally exchange information on video or phone.
- Use a private message (PM) in Slack.
- Use private/public key pairs to send sensitive data that requires regular transmission.
- Share information using Dropbox.

Don’t attach sensitive files to emails or share links to Dropbox via email. Instead use Dropbox sharing features directly. Use the principle of minimum required access and only offer write access if required. Note that Dropbox allows things to be shared ‘read-only’.

Everyone should be aware that email they receive may not originate from the source it purports to come from. A common threat is phishing, an attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity. All email requests for sensitive information should be verified independently, not by using links or phone numbers included in the email, but instead using previously-vetted contact information to call or contact the person to confirm the request.
